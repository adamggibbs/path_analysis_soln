# Path Analysis Homework Solution
This directory contains the solution to the path analysis homework given. All files and directories added by me are listed in the section below with a brief description of what they contain. All other files were imported from the original assignment repo from Machina Labs. 

## The files
- **analysis.ipynb:** This Python notebook contains the full analysis of the log files including code, write-up, and visualizations. The order roughly correlates with the process I took in analyzing the log files minus the unecessary components.
- **summary_report.md:** This Markdown file contains highlights of the full analysis and the main insights I drew from analyzing the log files. This includes write up and visualizations.
- **notes.md:** This Markdown file contains various unedited notes that pertained to thoughts I had as I went through analyzing the log files.
- **figs (dir):** This directory contains all the PNG files of the visualizations created during this analysis. All figures in this folder are also contained in analysis.ipynb.
